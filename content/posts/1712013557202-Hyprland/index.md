Some info about how and why I setup my workflow the way I do. So I use stratchpads 
a lot (that would be special workspaces for hyprland) cus I can easily put a browser 
or a terminal in there, and i can just hit Win + y (for a terminal) or Win + u (for a browser).

### Plugins I Use:
- [hy3](https://github.com/Trensa-Organization/hy3)
- [split-monitor-workspaces](https://github.com/Trensa-Organization/split-monitor-workspaces)

# Why I use the workflow that I do
How to setup hyprland in my work style.

## Prerequisites
1. A fresh install of a linux distro with all build dependencies of [Hyprland](https://wiki.hyprland.org/Getting-Started/Installation/) (also of [Hyprlang]() and [Hyprcursor]()) installed.

2. Have installed all the [required](https://kaleyfischer.xyz/posts/1712013557202-hyprland/#required-software) software, [waybar](https://github.com/Alexays/Waybar), [hyprpaper](https://wiki.hyprland.org/Hypr-Ecosystem/hyprpaper/), etc. 

### Required Software
Software that is required to copy the workflow I use. (ofc you don't have to copy my entire workflow but parts if you find somethings usefull)

- kitty, waybar, Hyprpaper, grim, slurp, swappy, RapidMenu, rofi

#### Why did I choose for these types of software?
So for the terminal I use [kitty](https://github.com/kovidgoyal/kitty) a good terminal that has basically everything tmux has
plus it has an easily configurable config, and for wallpaper management I use [hyprpaper]() it's simple and it just works.
The bar i use is [waybar]() it seems to be the most simple out of all of them and i haven't tried [ewww]() yet but it seems to 
be quite complicated to work with might make a post about it. (if so i'll link it [here]()) Screenshots I use [grim]() to screenshot, 
[slurp]() to select the area to be screenshot and [swappy] for the gui. For the menus (rofi menus) I use my self made tool
called [RapidMenu]() So what it does is it makes you able to write a simple toml config for [rofi]() (or any [dmenu]() like runner)
and runs it like a script so no needs for scripts just use configs! well for most things. And for the runner i use [rofi]()
it is similiar enough to dmenu and not as clunky as dmenu.
